# Alien-Invasion-Game
This project's sole aim is to improve my python skills.
In this particular project we are creating an Alien Invasion game. This makes use of the pygame module that exists within python.
In the game, the player has 3 attempts to ensure they shoot the alien before losing the game to start again.
The player controls the ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. This is done by the player by use of the left and right arrow keys to move the ship either direction.
If the player shoots all the aliens, a new sweep of aliens will come faster than the previous fleet.

This has been discontinued for reasons being the material i have been using has been deemed outdated and thus some functionalities are either missing, incompatible or any other reason.
That doesn't mean you cant play around with the ship coz it moves left and rght at least lol :)


Its been a good run and i enjoyed every part of it tbh.
