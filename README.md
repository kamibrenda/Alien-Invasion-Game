# Alien-Invasion-Game
This project's sole aim is to improve my python skills.
In this particular project we are creating an Alien Invasion game. This makes use of the pygame module that exists within python.
In the game, the player has 3 attempts to ensure they shoot the alien before losing the game to start again.
The player controls the ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. This is done by the player by use of the left and right arrow keys to move the ship either direction.
If the player shoots all the aliens, a new sweep of aliens will come faster than the previous fleet.
